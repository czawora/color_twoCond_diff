#### What am I doing?

The idea of the following document is to help me organize my thoughts as I attempt to implement this two condition, multi-level model while following the steps of the Bayesian workflow.


My intention for the layout of this folder is that, in addition to this document, there are at first two other folders, `sandbox/` and `data_summary/`. `sandbox/` is intended to contain any exploration of how I would implement a part of the workflow. One-off scripts that I use to flush out intermediary steps or hiccups I encounter while trying to get something to work. `data_summary/` will contain any scripts I use to explore the data, without any Bayesian inferential modeling.


All the other folders should be different models I iterate upon. Each folder would contain subfolders that match steps in the workflow:

* Prior predictive check

* Simulation based calibration (computational faithfulness) - would involve biowulf

* Parameter recovery (Model sensitivity) - would involve biowulf

* Model fitting

* Posterior predictive check + Bayes Factors + CV (Model accuracy)


As I am going along these steps for any given model (model = likelihood + prior + design + sample size) I might encounter that I need to change the model (change the priors or the likelihood based on pre-fit checks OR expanding the model based on model accuracy checks OR the design has change and I have new conditions or more samples). Once I decide to modify the model I will make a new folder where I will start repeating the steps for the modified model. 

For example, I would begin with a folder `m1/` that would be the initial modeling attempt. At any point in the workflow when I decide I need to change the model, I would create a new folder `m2/` and begin again. I should also try to make notes in this file to help keep track of the transitions between models.

#### Model expansion history

m1 - the model I already started concocting before arranging this workflow structure. A linear model on the VM uniform mixture parameters kappa and pMem. Varying effcts for subjects on the pre condition intercept and pre-post slope. Kappa LM is log linked and the the pMem LM is logit linked. I already came up with a set of initial weakly informative priors. 

the data for this particular version of the model is from the stimulation color short term memory task.
